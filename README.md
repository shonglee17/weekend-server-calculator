Description
Duration: 2 Week Sprint

Directly below this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

This project took me 7 hours to develop. I worked with communication between the client and server sides. A problem I was dealing with was working with the values that were sent over from the client side to server side. I realized I needed a variable on the server side to contain the values from the client side before I could work with the values themselves.
